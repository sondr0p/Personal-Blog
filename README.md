# Personal Blog

This is a fun blog I created using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end and [Django-Rest-Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for the backend. I styled the website using [this](https://bootswatch.com/lux/) template from Bootswatch. I used the default database (SQLite) that comes with Django but feel free to use your preferred database.

## Usage
To run the back-end, run this command in a unix terminal

```
python manage.py runserver
```

To run the front-end, run this command in a unix terminal (note this is only for development)

```
npm run dev
```
